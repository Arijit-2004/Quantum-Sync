# Fraud Detection Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a fraud detection website developed by a team of four individuals. The website is designed to detect fraudulent activities using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model implemented in scikit-learn. The frontend of the website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Flask.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The website provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the fraud detection system.

- **Real-time Prediction:** Users can input relevant data, and the SVM model will provide a real-time prediction regarding the likelihood of fraud.

- **Visualizations:** The website includes visualizations to help users understand the data and the model's predictions better.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **Backend:**
  - Flask

- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine) from scikit-learn
