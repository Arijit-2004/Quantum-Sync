        What is the purpose of the transaction fraud system?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            The purpose of our transaction fraud system is to detect and prevent fraudulent activities within financial transactions.
             By implementing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques in Python, we analyze transaction data to identify patterns indicative of potential fraud.

    <div class="faq2">
      <button class="accordian">
        How does the fraud detection algorithm work?        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            Our fraud detection algorithm employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
             It learns from historical transaction data, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior. Features such as transaction amount, location, and frequency are considered to create a robust model.

      <button class="accordian">
        What role does Python play in the project?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            Python serves as the primary 
            programming language for our project. It is used to implement the fraud detection algorithms, preprocess data, and create a streamlined pipeline for analyzing and flagging potentially fraudulent transactions.

        How is Power BI utilized in the data analytics aspect of the project?        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            Power BI is employed for data visualization and reporting. It allows us to create interactive dashboards
             and reports that provide insights into the trends and patterns identified by our fraud detection system. Power BI enhances the interpretability of our findings and facilitates decision-making.

        How is the accuracy of the fraud detection system measured and validated?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            The accuracy of our fraud detection system is measured using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. We validate 
            the model's performance by comparing its predictions against known instances of fraud and non-fraud transactions in our dataset.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq6">
      <button class="accordian">
        How scalable is the fraud detection system, and can it handle a growing volume of transactions?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
            Our fraud detection system is designed with scalability in mind. It can handle a growing volume of transactions by leveraging distributed computing and efficient algorithms. As transaction volume increases, the system's performance scales accordingly to maintain its effectiveness.
